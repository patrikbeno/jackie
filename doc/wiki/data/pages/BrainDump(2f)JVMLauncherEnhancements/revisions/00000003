= JVM Preloading =

'''Goal:''' faster application startup

'''Idea:''' JVM waits in background, listens on a specific port for trigger; specific classes are loaded but not initialized; native launcher connects to a given port where the standby JVM awaits startup signal. Triggering launcher becomes new standby JVM


What classes to preload?
:: 1st instance will incrementally build list of all classes loaded in an interval called application boot interval (say, first few minutes...)
