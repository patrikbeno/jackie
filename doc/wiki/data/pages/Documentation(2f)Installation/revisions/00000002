= Overview =

Jackie is plain Java library built using Maven.
Installation process deploys (1) Jackie modules into local Maven repository and (2) utility scripts, documentation, etc into current directory (where installation process is ran from)

= Prerequisities =

You need:

 1. Java Runtime Environment (http://java.sun.com/). Download here: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp 
 1. Maven (http://maven.apache.org). Download here: http://maven.apache.org/download.html

Windows (optional, recommended):

 1. Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/). Download here: http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe


= Download =

There are several installtation options:

 1. online installation via Maven
 1. partially offline installation 
 1. full offline installation

Online installation (#1) should be '''easiest''' and is ideal for incremental updates. 

Full offline (#2) is supposed to be '''most reliable''' and '''fastest'''. Suitable for users with fast internet connections who don't mind downloading packages several megabytes in size.

Semi-offline (#2) installation is a compromise between big downloads and installation speed. Only Jackie libraries are distributed and its dependencies are updated/downloaded online using Maven.

Visit [[Download]] page.

= Online Installation =

Create directory where you want Jackie to be installed, download installation pom and save it to this directory. Execute {{{mvn -Dsetup=online}}} to start installation.

Whole process is in a little more exact manner described below:

{{{
# configuration
jackie_home=/path/to/jackie
install_pom="http://archiva.greenhorn.sk/archiva/repository/snapshots/org/jackie/org.jackie.install/0.1-SNAPSHOT/org.jackie.install-0.1-20081022.221657-6.pom"

cd $jackie_home

# download install pom
wget -O pom.xml $install_pom

# run install
mvn -Dsetup=online
}}}

This may take a few moments even on a local network.
