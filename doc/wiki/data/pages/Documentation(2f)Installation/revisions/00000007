= Overview =

Jackie is plain Java library built using Maven.
Installation process deploys (1) Jackie modules into local Maven repository and (2) utility scripts, documentation, etc into current directory (where installation process is ran from)

= Prerequisities =

You need:

 1. Java Runtime Environment (http://java.sun.com/). Download here: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp 
 1. Maven (http://maven.apache.org). Download here: http://maven.apache.org/download.html

Windows (optional, recommended):

 1. Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/). Download here: http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe


= Download =

Get the latest installation POM from [[Download]] page.
Create directory where you want Jackie to be installed, download installation pom and save it to this directory. 

= Install =

Execute {{{mvn -Dsetup}}} to start installation.

Whole process is in a little more exact manner described below:

{{{
# configuration
jackie_home=/path/to/installation/directory
install_pom="http://archiva.greenhorn.sk/archiva/repository/snapshots/org/jackie/org.jackie.install/${version}/${pomfile}"

cd $jackie_home

# download install pom
wget -O pom.xml $install_pom

# run install
mvn -Dsetup [-Dofflinerepo=file:/path/to/downloaded/offline/package]
}}}

This may take a few moments even on a local network. 

= Verify Installation =

Jackie libraries should be installed by maven into your local maven repository along with all required dependencies. Check {{{~/.m2/repository/org/jackie}}} or wherever your local repository is.
