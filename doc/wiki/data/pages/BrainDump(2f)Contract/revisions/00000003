= General Contract Definition =

== Method Parameters ==

 @Optional::
 :: parameter can be null; default is NOT null
 
== Method Return Values ==

 @Nullable:: 
 :: method can return NULL value; default is NOT NULL

== Issues ==

Maybe contract model should be chosen so that the compilation won't break standard code (i.e. without any contract annotations).
This means that the '''defaults''' should be chosen so that they '''add''' behaviour, not that their absence '''changes behaviour'''.

Therefore, no {{{@optional}}}, no {{{@Nullable}}}, just:

 @NotNull::
 :: parameter cannot be null; method cannot return null value; field cannot be null after instance initialization is finished
