The above idea tries to make assumptions about reasonable defaults: parameters '''mostly''' cannot be null, methods '''mostly''' don't return null values. Reasonable defaults would limit the need for repetive '''declaring the obvious'''

'''However:'''

Maybe contract model should be chosen so that the compilation won't break standard code (i.e. without any contract annotations).
This means that the '''defaults''' should be chosen so that they '''add''' behaviour, not that their absence '''changes behaviour'''.

Therefore, no {{{@optional}}}, no {{{@Nullable}}}, just:

 @NotNull::
 :: parameter cannot be null; method cannot return null value; field cannot be null after instance initialization is finished
